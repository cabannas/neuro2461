# Neural Essentials - Neurocomputing Project

## Description
"Neural Essentials" is a project designed for the Neurocomputing course within the Computer Engineering program at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. This project focuses on developing a neural network from scratch to solve simple problems. The primary objective is to facilitate a deeper understanding of the underlying structure and fundamental concepts of neural networks.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Understanding of basic neural network concepts
- Mathematical libraries such as NumPy for matrix operations

## Development
During the Neurocomputing course, Daniel Cabanas and Judith Manchon were tasked with the challenge of constructing a neural network without the aid of high-level neural network libraries. In 2019, a dedicated group of students accomplished this task, gaining practical insights into the operational mechanisms of neural networks. The project, "Neural Essentials," serves as a testament to their work, demonstrating the ability to implement learning algorithms capable of pattern recognition and problem-solving based on the fundamental principles of neural computation.
